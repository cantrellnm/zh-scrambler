# zh-scrambler

An app to practice (simplified) Chinese language skills by unscrambling sentences. Sentences are sourced from [Tatoeba](https://tatoeba.org/en/). They are organized roughly by [HSK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanyu_Shuiping_Kaoshi) 3.0 level, based on the level at which all hanzi (characters) in the sentence have been introduced in HSK 3.0 vocabulary. (Level not based on vocabulary or grammar!) Dictionary information about the hanzi is sourced from [CC-CEDICT](https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary?page=cedict).
